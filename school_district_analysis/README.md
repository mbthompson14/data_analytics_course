# school_district_analysis

## Project Summary
The purpose of this analysis was to identify trends in standardized test scores for a school district. To clean the data, all duplicate records and records containing empty values were dropped, leaving a total of 14,831 records for the anlaysis. The most noteable finding was that math scores were to be higher in charter schools compared to public schools for all grades except grade 12, while reading scores were higher in public schools for all grades except grade 11. To further explore and confirm the predictors of test scores, I would recommend conducting statistical testing with school name, school type, and grade as factors in a linear mixed model.
