# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview

The Company is anticipating a large number of its employees retiring in upcoming years. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the number and titles of roles the Company should be prepared to fill. Additionally, certain retirement-age employees were identified as eligible for a mentorship program.

## Results

The analysis revealed that:

- The total number of employees expected to retire in upcoming years is 72,458
- The majority of expected retirees are either Senior Engineers or Senior Staff (~70%)
- 1,549 of the anticipated retirees are eligible for the mentorship program
- The majority of mentorship-eligible, anticipated retirees are either Senior Staff or Engineers (~69%)

## Summary

In sum, the Company should be prepared to fill approximately 72,458 roles, the majority of which are Senior roles. Only about 2% of the anticipated retirees are eligible to become mentors for new employees, meaning a 1:50 mentor to new employee ratio if all eligible retirees accept. This ratio is less favorable for Senior Engineers and more favorable for Engineers. I recommend hiring new employees in waves so the mentors are able to accomodate training needs. Two additional queries may provide more insight into the anticipated retirements: (1) looking at the total salaries of anticipated retirees by department so we know how to reallocate our budget and (2) identifying employees who have worked for the Company for a certain number of years who can potentially be promoted to the vacant roles.
